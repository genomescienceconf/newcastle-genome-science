Please, check that you get the right directions. Google Maps provides the correct directions to the venue if you set your directions to “Luke Jerram’s Palm Temple” (as in the Google Maps link above). However, if directions are set to the School of Chemistry, then Google Maps will send you to the back of the building instead of the main entry in Cantock's Close.
